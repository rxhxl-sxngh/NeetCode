# Sort Ascending

Solved

**In Python, you can sort a list of elements by calling** `.sort()` on the list.

```python
elements = [5, 3, 6, 2, 1]

elements.sort()

print(elements) # [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
```

**By default, the** `.sort()` method sorts the elements in *ascending* order *in-place*. The return value of the `.sort()` method is `None`.

**This method also works for a list of strings.**

```python
elements = ["grape", "apple", "banana", "orange"]

elements.sort()

print(elements) # ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'orange']
```

**By default, strings are sorted in lexicographical order.**

## Challenge

**Implement the following functions:**

1. `sort_words(words: List[str]) -> List[str]` - This function accepts a list of words and returns the list of words sorted in ascending order.
2. `sort_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]` - This function accepts a list of numbers and returns the list of numbers sorted in ascending order.
3. `sort_decimals(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]` - This function accepts a list of decimal numbers and returns the list of decimal numbers sorted in ascending order.

## Time and Space Complexity

* **The time complexity of the** `.sort()` method is O(nlogn), where `n` is the number of elements in the list.
* **The space complexity is O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the list.

***Note***: Python uses the Timsort algorithm for sorting lists. Timsort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort. To learn more about sorting, check out the Data Structures and Algorithms for Beginners course.
