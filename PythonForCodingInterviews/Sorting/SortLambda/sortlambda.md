# Sort Lambda

Solved

**Defining a separate function just to pass it into the** `key` parameter of the `.sort()` method can be cumbersome. We can use a *lambda function* to define a function in a single line and pass it directly to the `.sort()` method.

**To sort a list of words by their length, we can use a lambda function like this:**

```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi", "pear", "watermelon", "blueberry", "cherry"]

words.sort(key=lambda word: len(word))

print(words) # ['kiwi', 'pear', 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'blueberry', 'watermelon']
```

**The lambda function** `lambda word: len(word)` is equivalent to the function `get_word_length` we defined in the previous example. It takes a word as input and returns the length of the word.

**The syntax includes:**

1. **The keyword** `lambda`.
2. **The input variable** `word`. We can use any variable name here.
3. **The colon** `:`, after which we define the function body.
4. **The expression** `len(word)`, which is the return value of the function.

**A lambda function must be a single expression, and it cannot contain multiple statements. It's a convenient way to define simple functions without the need to define a separate function.**

## Challenge

**Implement the following functions:**

1. `sort_words(words: List[str]) -> List[str]` - This function accepts a list of words and returns a new list of words sorted based on their length, in *descending order*. Use a lambda function to sort the words by their length.
2. `sort_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]` - This function accepts a list of numbers and returns a new list of numbers sorted based on their absolute value, in *ascending order*. Use a lambda function to sort the numbers by their absolute value.
