# Sort Custom

Solved

**We can also specify a custom sorting order by using the** `key` parameter in the `.sort()` method. The `key` parameter doesn't accept a value, instead, it accepts a *function* that returns a value to be used for sorting.

```python
def get_word_length(word: str) -> int:
    return len(word)

words = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi", "pear", "watermelon", "blueberry", "cherry"]

words.sort(key=get_word_length)

print(words) # ['kiwi', 'pear', 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'blueberry', 'watermelon']
```

**In the example above, we defined a function** `get_word_length` that returns the length of a word. We then passed this function as the `key` parameter to the `.sort()` method. This means the words will be sorted based on their length, in ascending order, and **not** based on their lexicographical order.

## Challenge

**Implement the following functions:**

1. `sort_words(words: List[str]) -> List[str]` - This function accepts a list of words and returns a new list of words sorted based on their length, in *descending order*.
2. `sort_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]` - This function accepts a list of numbers and returns a new list of numbers sorted based on their absolute value, in *ascending order*. Hint: You may use the `abs()` function to get the absolute value of a number.

***Hint***: You may define additional functions. Functions defined in the global scope are accessible within other functions.
