# Zip

Solved

**Python provides an easy way to iterate over multiple lists at the same time using the** `zip()` function. The `zip()` function takes multiple lists as arguments and returns an iterator of tuples. Each tuple contains an element from each list.

**This is useful when we have multiple lists of the same length and want to iterate over them together.**

```python
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David']
scores = [90, 85, 88, 92]

for name, score in zip(names, scores):
    print(f"{name} scored {score}")
```

## Challenge

**Implement the following function using** `zip()`:
* `group_names_and_scores(names: List[str], scores: List[int]) -> Dict[str, int]` that takes two lists, `names` and `scores`, and returns a dictionary where the key is `names[i]` and it maps to `scores[i]` as the value.

**You may assume the inputs** `names` and `scores` will always be the same length.

## Time and Space Complexity

* **Time complexity: O(1)**
   * **The** `zip()` function returns an iterator at the beginning of the input lists, so it doesn't traverse the entire lists.
* **Space complexity: O(1)**
   * The `zip()` function returns an iterator so it doesn't actually create a new list of tuples in memory.
