# Inequality
Solved
**Python allows us to take a small shortcut when making multiple comparisons.**
**The following code:**

```python
x = 5

if 0 < x and x < 10:
    print('x is between 0 and 10')

```

**Copy**
**is equivalent to:**

```python
x = 5

if 0 < x < 10:
    print('x is between 0 and 10')

```

**Copy**
**Notice that we didn't need the boolean **`and` in the second example. This is a small shortcut, but now you may start to see why people consider Python to practically be pseudocode.
**Challenge**
**Implement the following function:**
* `is_arr_valid(names: List[str], max_length: int) -> bool`. It should return `True` if the length of the `names` list is greater than 0 *and* less than or equal to the parameter `max_length`. Otherwise it should return `False`.
